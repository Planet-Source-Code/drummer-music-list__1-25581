Music List
By Drummer


This program is designed to database a users music according to the directory they specify.


When starting you must enter the number of lists you are going to use for each genre of music.
Second, name the list how you want them to appear in the menu.
Last, paste the directory for each list you named.
The program will create a database file called "Songs.lst".
If you rename or delete this file you will be required to create a new one or put another one in
	with the same name. (like a file from a friend to view their list)
Also a "Settings.ini" file is created to save the list names and directories you used last. (keep this one)


Use Music List to view you songs by alphabet or by each list.
Important - Double click a name to execute the file in its default player.   
	(***** Any file on the list that was created on the same computer can be executed *****)
	(*.wav, *.mp3, *.jpg, *.avi,... anything)
use the "copy list to clipboard" option and paste into word or other program in order to print out your list.
	(thought this would make it easiest to format the printed list how the user wants)



This program is distributed as is.  Any problems occuring from this program are bugs that I did not find.
